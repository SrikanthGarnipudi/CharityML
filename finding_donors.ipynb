    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the following 3 supervised learning algorithms selecting for this classification problem.\n",
    "1. Decision Trees\n",
    "2. Ada Boost\n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees Classifier:\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    - As currently we are in pandemic situation because of Covid-19, I would prefer to use Decision Tree to predict whether a patient tested covid-19 positive or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Simple to understand, interpret, visualize.\n",
    "    - It implicitly performs variable screening or feature selection.\n",
    "    - It requires relatively little effort from users for data preparation.\n",
    "    - Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "           \n",
    "    - Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well. This is called overfitting.\n",
    "    - Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This is called variance, which needs to be lowered by methods like bagging and boosting.\n",
    "    - Greedy algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "    - Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the data set prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - This is a classification problem and model needs to predict person is earning more than 50K using features such Age, occupation, education level, capital gain, hours per work and so on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ADA Boost Classifier:\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    - It is a best fit for complex and sensitive applications. Applications like whether a space agency launch a rocket or not. Identifying a sick patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - AdaBoost is easy to implement. It iteratively corrects the mistakes of the weak classifier and improves accuracy by combining weak learners. You can use many base classifiers with AdaBoost. AdaBoost is not prone to overfitting. This can be found out via experiment results, but there is no concrete reason available\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "           \n",
    "    - AdaBoost is sensitive to noise data. It is highly affected by outliers because it tries to fit each point perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Even though this application is not complex, but we can almost predict whether person donate to the charity organization or not using available feature values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines:\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Use of SVMs provides better search accuracy for image classification. It provides better accuracy in comparison to the traditional query-based searching techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - It works well with a clear margin of separation\n",
    "    - It is effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "    - It is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "    - It uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "           \n",
    "    - It doesn’t perform well when we have large data set because the required training time is higher\n",
    "    - It also doesn’t perform very well, when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping\n",
    "    - SVM doesn’t directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - It is good fit because we have higher dimensions or features to consider for this model to predict whether person can donate or not.\n",

    "Adaboost classifier is an ensemble machine learning algorithm. The basic principle of Ensemble is to combine more than one weak classifier into a strong or improved classifier. Combines different machine learning approaches into single predictive model to improve the performance. Adaboost is nothing but Adaptive boosting algorithm, in this weight is going to set for each classifier and then train the data sample in each iteration such that it can provide accurate predictions.        \n",
    "        What AdaBoost does is using a simple model to fit the best possible data, then it punishes the data that was not classified correctly by the first model incrementing its weight, and fits the same model but with more priority in the last wrongly classified data which results in a different model that classifies data differently. The process keeps going the number of times we want, in the end we get different expert models that classify certain kinds of data correctly, so we combine them and get a final model that is very robust\n",

    "- It assigns the weight to the trained classifier in each iteration according to the accuracy of the classifier. The more accurate classifier will get high weight.\n",
    "- This process iterates until the complete training data fits without any error or until reached to the specified maximum number of estimators.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
